# Execas

A program for gaining privilege in unix-like environments! Think `sudo` and `doas` but worse and insecure!

See the blogpost about how this works [here](https://snailscale.io/posts/understanding-sudo/)

## Running

1. build - `sudo make`
2. update the placeholder in execas.conf
3. exec - `./bin/execas`
